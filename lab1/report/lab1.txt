\section{Objective}
The objective of this laboratory exercise is to gain practical experience in using Generative AI tools for professional content creation. The lab focuses on structured prompt engineering, AI-based image generation, and AI-powered video creation using modern GenAI platforms.

\section{Tools Used}
The following tools were used in this experiment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Claude (for email generation)
    \item DALL-E (for poster generation)
    \item Fliki.ai (for video creation)
\end{itemize}

\section{Task Description}
A promotional campaign was created for a university workshop titled \textit{``Foundations of Generative AI and Its Applications''} to be conducted at RV University, Bengaluru. The campaign included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A formal workshop launch email
    \item A professional AI-generated poster
    \item A short narrated promotional video
\end{itemize}

\section{Email Draft Generation using Claude}
The launch email was generated using the Claude large language model. A structured prompt was designed using Role, Task, Context, and Constraints to ensure a professional and complete academic announcement.

\subsection{Email Prompt Used}
\begin{verbatim}
Role:
Act as a professional academic coordinator at RV University.

Task:
Draft a formal launch email announcing a one-day workshop on
“Foundations of Generative AI and Its Applications.”

Context:
The workshop is organized for undergraduate engineering students
at RV University, Bengaluru. The venue is Lecture Hall Complex,
RV University, Bengaluru. The event will be held next Friday.

Constraints:
The email must include the purpose of the workshop, date and venue,
target audience, key topics, benefits, registration instructions,
and contact information. The tone should be professional and motivating.
The length should be between 180 and 200 words.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Email Generated by Claude}
\begin{verbatim}

\section{AI Poster Generation using DALL-E}
A professional workshop poster was generated using DALL-E based on a detailed visual prompt.

\subsection{Image Prompt Used}
\begin{verbatim}
Create a high-resolution professional digital poster for a university-level
workshop titled “Foundations of Generative AI and Its Applications.”
The workshop is being held at RV University, Bengaluru, in the Lecture Hall Complex.

The poster should visually represent a modern Indian university environment with:
- Engineering students working on laptops and tablets
- AI and technology-themed visuals such as neural networks and futuristic interfaces
- A classroom or lecture hall setting

Design style and constraints:
- Color theme: blue and white
- Style: clean, modern, poster-style layout
- Include subtle technology and innovation motifs
- Include a dummy QR code with the text “Register Now”
- The image should look formal, polished, and suitable for university promotion.
\end{verbatim}

\section{AI Video Creation using Fliki}
A 30-second narrated promotional video was generated using Fliki.ai by converting a structured script into video scenes.

\subsection{Video Prompt Used}
\begin{verbatim}
Act as a professional promotional script writer for university events.
Create a 30-second promotional video for a workshop titled
“Foundations of Generative AI and Its Applications” at RV University, Bengaluru.

First outline the flow:
- Opening hook
- What the workshop is about
- What students will learn
- Who should attend
- Call to action

Then write the final narration script using short, clear sentences
suitable for AI voice-over.
