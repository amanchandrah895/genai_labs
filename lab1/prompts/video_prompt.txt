Act as a professional promotional script writer for university events.
I am creating a 30-second promotional video for a workshop titled “Foundations of Generative AI and Its Applications” at RV University, Bengaluru (Lecture Hall Complex).

First, outline the logical flow of the video in this order:

Opening hook

What the workshop is about

What students will learn

Who should attend

Call to action

After outlining the flow, write the final 30-second narration script using short, clear sentences suitable for AI voice-over.
